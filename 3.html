  <p>Economy
By 18 March, South Korea's KOSPI stock index had dropped nearly 30% from a month earlier. The drop began on 23 February, when the country raised the coronavirus alert to 'highest level'.[107] On 15 March, the KOSPI closed at 1,771.44 and the Kosdaq finished at 524 points, down 7%, prompting the Financial Supervisory Commission to impose a six-month ban on short-selling, the first such action in nearly nine years.
